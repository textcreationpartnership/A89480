            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>t is not ambition but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which makes me thus bold to intitle you <hi>Iobs</hi> Patron, your Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great to all who oppreſſed, make the armes of your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and humanity their Sanctuary. It is your honour to be great, your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be good: by the one you are
<pb facs="tcp:115191:3"/>made famous, by the other you will be immortall.</p>
            <p>The troubles of the Times are ſo great, and all men by them ſuch ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; that <hi>England</hi> had need to be a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
<hi>Iobs,</hi> that with patience they may run through the extremities which daily begin to coaſt us. And truly, if we would make <hi>Iobs</hi> example our Precept, it is to be beleeved we ſhould endure our ſufferings with more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like alacrity, and have a more Saint-like deliverance our of all our troubles.</p>
            <p>There are many materiall points in the Hiſtory which are peculiarly worth our obſervation: For firſt, we find him poſſeſſor of as much riches as his heart could wiſh, and immediately by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans malice robb'd of all. Oh never let<pb facs="tcp:115191:3"/>proſperity make us ſo ſecure, as to think our ſelves immoveable; for then is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger greateſt, when we ſuppoſe our ſelves ſafeſt: for <hi>quos perdere vult Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, hos dementat;</hi> an over-great ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is an infallible ſigne of ruine. If we ſtand, let us take heed leſt we fall; againe, he is not only afflicted out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in body, but is tormented in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in his mind by the temptations of his Wife, and his other friends who came to viſit him; wherein we may ſee the ſubtlety of that malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of mankind, who maketh even our deareſt friends his inſtruments to drive us to deſpaire: This ſhal ſuffice of much more which might be ſaid, for my work is an Epiſtle, not a Comment.</p>
            <p>Therefore not to interpo ſe in your more ſerious affaires; if your Honour<pb facs="tcp:115191:4"/>will daine out of your innate benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſtoope to the peruſall of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphraſe at your times of leaſure, and grace it with your Patronage, I ſhall then reſt aſſured that all hazards are paſt, and that it will go current through the wits of this our too curious and cenſorious Age, though cloathed in a dreſſe ſo meane as it is.</p>
            <p>However, my hopes perſwade me, that your perfect maturity will wink at the faults of my immature Youth, and that you will not be ſo curious to mark every failing, leſt my bloſſomes, being nipped in their ſpring, for ever loſe their hope of ripening; In confidence wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall hereafter lay no more claime to this Booke, but wholly reſigne it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your hands, and together with it my ſelfe, to whom it hath been a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:115191:4"/>recreation: but if it attaine the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of your teſte, I ſhall triumph in the happy ſucceſſe of my preſumptuous ambition; the reward ſo much exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proportion of my meane la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that I have no way ſufficient to expreſſe my gratitude, but in imitating thoſe birds, who having nothing elſe, brought their feathers to <hi>Apollo's</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to adorne it: here are my endeavors; And in things we would, if in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, the Will muſt be taken for the deed; In hopes vvhereof I aſſume the confidence to ſubſcribe my ſelfe,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ffliction is the only true touchſtone of Chriſtianity, driving one to lay hold on God by faith in hope of comfort; which conſideration made me pitch on <hi>Job,</hi> in whom may be found the very patterne of Chriſtian patience, my aime being to make his example our patterne, we living in times wherein we know not how ſoone we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to <hi>Jobs</hi> condition.</p>
            <p>I know not how pleaſing things of this nature may be, but their profit I am ſure is very great; which if the Reader find according to my deſire, I ſhall thinke my labors very well ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of my Metaphraſticall Tranſlation was, that I would not, as neere as I could, deviate from the very Letter of the Text, which I have as<pb facs="tcp:115191:6"/>little as poſsible; yet where the ſenſe was darke, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring ſever all Tranſlations together, and all with the originall, I made them eaſie to the moſt illiterate underſtanding: conceiving it better than a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, they often loſing, or at leaſt darkening halfe the ſenſe in their circumlocations, whereas this wholly keepes the ſenſe, and avoids its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity.</p>
            <p>Yet though my endeavours be never ſo Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-like, I expect not to pleaſe all, even aſſured to find the envious jerks of ſome malicious tongues, it being impoſsible to do any thing in this age with all mens approbation.</p>
            <p>All I deſire of thee (Reader) is this, that thou wouldſt bring a good will and cheerefull diſpoſition, void of all malicious envy, which at this day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly practiſed of moſt men (who like ſevere cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers) buſie themſelves rather in ſeeking what to bite at, and to reprehend in other mens workes, then to commend what is good, or aſſay to make them better, thereby verifying that old Greeke Proverbe,
